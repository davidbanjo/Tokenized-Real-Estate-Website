      MixFIts Tokenized real estate works by creating digital tokens that represent ownership units in a property. These tokens are then sold to investors who can buy and sell them on a blockchain-based platform. The ownership of the property is distributed among the token holders, who receive dividends or rental income based on their percentage ownership of the property. MixFIts is dedicated to making this process as seamless and effecient for all investors.

      MixFits Tokenized real estate offers several benefits to investors, including fractional ownership, increased liquidity, lower costs, and access to a global investor base. Fractional ownership means that investors can buy and own a smaller portion of a property, which allows them to diversify their investments across multiple properties. Increased liquidity means that investors can easily buy and sell their tokens on a blockchain-based platform. Lower costs are achieved by removing intermediaries, such as brokers and lawyers, from the transaction process. Finally, access to a global investor base means that investors can invest in real estate properties located anywhere in Africa.
